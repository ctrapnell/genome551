This work has played such a large role in the conceptualization of gene regulatory phenomena extending over many decades that we will be stepping through the key points of the paper sequentially.  The high-level themes/questions to consider are:

1. What is the relative importance assigned to positive (activator) vs. negative (repressor) regulation?
